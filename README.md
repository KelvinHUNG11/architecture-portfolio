A showcase of my past work, key flow and parts are re-designed for privacy purpose. 

# System & Workflow Design Showcase

This repository showcases my past work in system architecture and workflow design, highlighting my ability to design scalable APIs and integrate ML workflows. These assets were created as part of personal and collaborative projects, including a privacy-aware ML tool and a Node.js server.

## Showcase 1

### System Design
![Sample system architecture design](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/166e1e5b-e855-461b-9acc-ff057eb56270)

- **Description**: A high-level architecture for a distributed system integrating a web portal, application server, and PostgreSQL database.
- **Context**: Designed for an API-driven ML validation service.
- **Tools**: Draw.io, exported as PNG.

### Workflow Design

- **Description**: Sequence diagram for an API request (`start_validate`), detailing interactions across web, app, and external servers.
- **Context**: Part of a real-time validation process tied to a JavaScript server.
- **Tools**: Sequencediagram.org, exported as SVG.

## Why This Matters
These designs reflect my approach to modular, scalable systems—key for roles in backend development, ML integration, or privacy engineering. They’re part of a broader vision for a privacy-focused ML product developed with friends in Hong Kong.
